# KERN - Kerbin Council for Nuclear Research

KERN is a mod that will implement particle physics into the game as a way to gather rare resources like anti-matter. There will be three models of a particle accelerator. Small, Large, and XL versions all unlocked via a tech tree. The components will only work with the correct size (can't combine an XL with a S). To keep sizes down, each model is going to contain multiple components organized in a way that allows them to be pieced together to create a functional particle accelerator. The player will be able to add any amount of components together as long as they're the correct size. Key components will be the beam generator and collector. The Waveguides will be attachable to each other. The more you attach, the longer your particle accelerator will be. For practical purposes, you won't need a ridiculously long particle accelerator to harvest anti-matter. For fun, maybe you wrap kerbin in a particle accelerator? 

Low Tech - Small (Present)
Med Tech - Large (Near Future)
High Tech - XL (Far future)

As Science mode is introduced I'll be working on a long journey of creating a particle accelerator for KSP 2. The plan is for it to be used on Kerbin to create anti-matter (or some rare fuel type). This is my first big project and first I want to start with the modelling process.
